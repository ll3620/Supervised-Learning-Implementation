# Supervised-Learning-Implementation

This repository contains the coursework completed for the 'Methods of Data Science' module under the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London.

The primary objective of this project was to gain an understanding of the mathematical properties behind various supervised learning techniques, including:

1. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and KNN Regression

2. Random forest on imbalanced datasheet

3. Soft-margin Linear SVM and soft-margin kernelised SVM (sigmoid kernel)


All techniques were implemented without using any pre-built Python packages like sklearn or statsmodel. Relevant illustrations are included in the Jupyter notebook file. Performance of the trained models was not the top priority in this project; instead, our focus was on rigorous mathematical understanding and interpretation.
